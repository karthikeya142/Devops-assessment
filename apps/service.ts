The next generation of technologies such as 5G, IoT, and Blockchain are synonymous with cloud native architecture. Equipped with horizontal scalability, geo-redundancy, and minimum MTTR, Cloud native architectures are opening a new realm of possibility with their one core functionality– Microservices.

Microservice is dedicated to a differentiated function of an application with its own resource model, APIs, and execution stack. These microservices are typically loosely coupled, and they often interact via APIs. Each of the microservices can be upgraded or scaled independently without affecting the whole application because they are agnostic to their cloud infrastructure. Packaged into containers (such as Docker), they can run in a highly distributed manner, maintaining independence and allocating resources based on the application needs.

With the pandemic forcing companies to go remote, Cloud native architecture is no longer just a competitive edge but a ‘must have’ to build a consistent experience across your network and be future-ready. Anuta Networks allows your organization to take full advantage of cloud computing by delivering cloud-native network automation with continuous integrations to keep abreast with changing needs.
